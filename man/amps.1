.TH AlsaModularSynth 1 "May 2009"
.SH NAME
AlsaModularSynth (AMS) - A software synthesizer modeled after modular
patching synthesizers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "ams [" OPTIONS "] [" file "]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B AlsaModularSynth
(AMS) is a software synthesizer designed after the great analog modular
synths of the 1960s. It employs virtual control voltages (VC) for each
 module's parameter control, using the the 
.B Moog
synthesizer's 1V/oct logarithmic control scale for its oscillator and
filter functions.

Following the modular synth model
.B AMS
supplies the user with a variety of sound-producing and sound-processing
software modules such as digital oscillators, filters, amplifiers, and
DSP effects. These modules are linked together (patched) to create
complex audio synthesis networks. These network patches can be played in
realtime via MIDI or internal control structures, and they may be saved
and reloaded at will.
